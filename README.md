## Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Model

### Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict hotel booking cancellations. Leveraging a dataset comprising 30 diverse features, the model utilizes advanced algorithms to forecast the likelihood of a booked hotel reservation being canceled. By analyzing various factors such as booking lead time, previous cancellations, customer demographics, and seasonal trends, the model provides valuable insights for hotel management to optimize resource allocation, occupancy rates, and revenue management strategies.

### Features:

- **Comprehensive Data Coverage:** The model incorporates 30 different features extracted from hotel booking records, including booking dates, customer details, room type, and reservation channels.
  
- **Predictive Accuracy:** Through extensive training on historical booking data, the model achieves high accuracy in forecasting cancellation probabilities, enabling proactive decision-making and operational planning.
  
- **Business Insights:** By identifying patterns and trends within the data, the model offers actionable insights into booking behavior, seasonal variations, and customer preferences, empowering hotel management to make informed decisions.
  
- **Efficiency and Optimization:** With its predictive capabilities, the model assists hotels in optimizing room allocation, staffing levels, and revenue generation strategies, ultimately improving overall operational efficiency and financial performance.
